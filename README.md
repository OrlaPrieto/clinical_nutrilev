# ClinicalNutrilev

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.2.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Backend Server

To set up and run the Python Flask backend for menu processing, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Run the backend**:
   ```bash
   python api/index.py
   ```

The backend will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
